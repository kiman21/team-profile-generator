# team-profile-generator

##Description

In this project I created an html generator to easily create pages for teams and their employees. The app uses Jest for testing and the npm inquirer package to prompt the user and generate a webpage from the prompt responses.

##Installation

Run npm i to install the required npm package.

##Usage

To use, open the command terminal and enter node index.js. Answer the subsequent prompts, then a HTML file should be generated with information about the team manager and any other employees added to the team.
